    <h1>About Blackjack</h1>
    <p>I despise casinos.</p>
    <p>
      They prey upon emotionally-vulnerable people to suck all the money out of
      their pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      All their games are statistically calculated to give them a long-term
      advantage over the player.
    </p>
    <p>
      This hurts the average casino-goer on a deep level, since now they're
      addicted to the short-term marvels of a potential big gain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The casino knows the players will keep coming and slowly lose money
      long-term.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if that wasn't enough on a moral level, they also don't like people who
      are perceptive enough to figure out what's being done.
    </p>
    <p>
      People who study statistics and probability are not welcome in casinos,
      because casinos know they're gonna lose money to them.
    </p>
    <p>So what's left to do?</p>
    <p>
      <b
        >Infiltrate and get as much money from casinos as possible before they
        catch wind of it.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>Figure their games out and rob them legally.</p>
    <p>
      Bring down the house edge to a minimum and even find ways to nullify and
      surpass it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beat them at their own game - become so good at math that they won't know
      what hit them.
    </p>
    <h3>Learn Blackjack</h3>
    <p>Learning Blackjack Basic Strategy brings the house edge down to 0.5%.</p>
    <p>This means the casino will only win 50.5% of the time on average.</p>
    <p>For every $100 you bet, you are expected to lose only 50 cents.</p>
    <p>
      Alongside Card Counting, the house edge is further reduced by about 0.5% for every +1 True Count.
    </p>
    <p>You will surpass the house edge long-term and rip casinos to shreds.</p>
    <p><b>But don't let them find out about what you're doing!</b></p>
    <p>Play Blackjack and see if you can bleed the casino dry.</p>
    <p>In real life they'll catch you, but you can at least do it here.</p>
